#+title: Designing Glyphs
* Prface: O Time, Thy Pyramids!
/Insert nostalgic crap about internet archaeology. Many are the pages
lost to bitrot and the vicissitudes of domain registrars, few are
those preserved by the internet archive. And Angelus Novus weeps at
the remains of this colossal wreck./

So back in the day Gary Shannon of the conlang listserv had a silent,
logographic conlang that was basically a bigger version of a 7-segment
display. Unfortunately, that design (called "Neoglyphic") is gone, and
the oldest references to it on the wayback machine refer to it a
"lost" precursor to some (now ancient) projects.

* Glyph formula
- Let there be a grid of points /i×j/.
- The space between each index in /i/ is a column, and that between each
  index in /j/ is a row.
- A segment may connect any point /i[m]×j[n]/ to any of its <=4 adjacent
  points.

- Each segment may be on or off: therefore there are 2^(/i×j/) possible
  ways of filling in the grid.
- For keming reasons, we must restrict this space to only glyphs
  filling the entire grid.
- Each row and each column must have at least one stroke passing
  through it.
- Every column in /i/ has /j/ possible segments, and every row in /j/ has /i/
  possible segments.

- Every column and every row must have at least one segment.

Am I correct in thinking the following:

- There are /j/ rows in /i/, each requiring one or more strokes to be on.
- Similarly there are /i/ columns in /j/, each requiring one or more
  strokes to be on.
- Therefore the number of valid glyphs in a grid is expressed by the
  following formula: =i×2^(j-1)+j×2^(i-1)=
